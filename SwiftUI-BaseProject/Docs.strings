both coding styles are same , as long as there is no code b/w views and modifiers it's valid
 
=> use system fonts,colors because it will dynamically handle i.e if we use color.systembackgroud it will change based on dark mode and light mode , if we use font(.body) it's size will adjust based on device size
 
=> use Color("customcolorliteralfromassets") for custom colors
=> use Image(systemName:"heart.fill").font(.body).foregroundColor(.red)
=> Image(systemName:"heart.fill").aspectRatio(contentMode:.fit) or
=> Image(systemName:"heart.fill").scaleToFit()
=> above two styles are same
=> use Image(systemName:"heart.fill").clipShape(Circle())
=> use .frame(maxWidth:.infinity) to occupy whole device width
=> Every single View has default frame bcos of this we can see default blue frame in preview UI ,  but we can modify it.
=> background is for behind the view
 => overlay is for front the view , remember overlay has alignment option used to achieve fav option
 =>Always extract subviews and reuse them
 
 => @state notifies View to call body method again
 => @Binding connection between child and parent views
 =>use .transition(.slide) and animation to slide view from anyside to view etc

 => environment(\.colorScheme)
 => environment(\.presentationMode)
 

 => @StateObject - Use this ON Creation or Init , It will NOT reload everytime View will reload
 => @ObservedObject - Use this FOR SUBVIEWS , It will reload everytime View will reload
